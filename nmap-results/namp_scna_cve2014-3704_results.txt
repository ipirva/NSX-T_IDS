|   Drupal - pre Auth SQL Injection Vulnerability
|     State: VULNERABLE (Exploitable)
|     IDs:  CVE:CVE-2014-3704
|         The expandArguments function in the database abstraction API in
|         Drupal core 7.x before 7.32 does not properly construct prepared
|         statements, which allows remote attackers to conduct SQL injection
|         attacks via an array containing crafted keys.
